# DACodingChallenge

My solution to an online coding challenge, extracting data from a text file and compiling a message based on triangular numbers.

The file is run using Node on the command line, with the command

"node pyramid.js pyramid.txt"

pyramid.txt is not included in this file for confidentiality purposes, but this solution should parse any .txt file that has multiple lines of text, spaces and numbers.
